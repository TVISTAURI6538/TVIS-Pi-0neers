# Mechanism 
## Steering
We have implemented **Ackerman's steering mechanism** for the steering system. We chose this system because it met all our requirements and was the best fit for our robot. We conducted extensive research to find the ideal steering system for our robot. We tested several steering systems, including rack and pinion steering, electronic rear motor steering, 4-wheel steering, and hydraulic steering. However, each of these mechanisms had significant drawbacks that would hinder our robot's performance. The servo-based Ackerman's steering emerged as the perfect choice, offering excellent speed and precise turning, even on sharp turns.

We selected the Ackermann steering system for several reasons. First, it helps reduce tire wear by minimizing tire scrubbing during turns, ultimately extending the lifespan of the tires. Additionally, this system provides improved handling and stability, effectively preventing understeer and oversteer by ensuring that all wheels follow their intended paths during turns. Moreover, vehicles equipped with Ackermann steering exhibit a more predictable and consistent steering response, which is particularly crucial for high-performance vehicles that require precise control. Furthermore, this steering system contributes to safer cornering, especially at higher speeds, by reducing the likelihood of tire scrubbing and maintaining better traction during turns. Lastly, Ackermann steering enhances maneuverability in low-speed maneuvers such as parking and tight turns, allowing for a smaller turning radius and making the vehicle more maneuverable and easier to handle in confined spaces. Considering these factors, it was evident that Ackermann's mechanism was the best choice for our needs.
